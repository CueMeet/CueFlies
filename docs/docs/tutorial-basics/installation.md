# Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up CueFlies on your local machine for development. There are two ways to install and run CueFlies:

1. [Docker Installation](./docker-installation) - Recommended for most users as it provides an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-configured, including PostgreSQL and Redis.
2. [Direct Installation](./direct-installation) - For users who prefer to run services directly on their machine.

Choose the installation method that best suits your development needs. The Docker installation is recommended for most users as it ensures a consistent development environment across different machines.
